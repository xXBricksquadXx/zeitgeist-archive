## 👁️ THE MISSION

"Truth is not told, it is realized."

This repository serves as a digital vault for the **remastered edition** of _Zeitgeist (2007)_. In an era of shifting information and digital decay, this project exists to ensure the 1080p high-fidelity restoration remains accessible to those looking at the world from a critical perspective.

## 🛠️ TECH STACK (ARCHIVE CORE)

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.0
- **Storage:** Decentralized via IPFS / Encapsulated via Google Cloud
- **Deployment:** Vercel Edge

## 📁 REPOSITORY STRUCTURE

- `/src/app` - The Archive UI
- `/public` - High-impact visual assets & preview loops
- `/src/components` - Brutalist UI components

## 🎞️ MASTER ARCHIVE ACCESS

The full **7.5GB Remastered Master** is too heavy for the standard web. It is hosted externally to bypass centralization constraints:
